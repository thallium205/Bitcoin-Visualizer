The gwt-vecmath library was a minor modification from the original Java vecmath 
library (https://vecmath.dev.java.net/) Most of the source codes remain as they 
were, with some modification and deletion in order to get them to work in GWT,
as well as some removal of unused codes to get rid of compiler warnings.
The license for this library is the same as vecmath's license included in this
package.
