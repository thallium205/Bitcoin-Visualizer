This package can be downloaded at http://code.google.com/p/gwt-g3d/

Starting with v0.05, gwt-g3d.jar will also include gwt-g2d.jar and gwt-vecmath.jar in it,
so you no longer need to add them to your build path separately.

To use the gwt-g3d library, please include this line in your .gwt.xml file:

<inherits name='gwt.g3d.g3d'/>
